This program is for educational purpose only.
it tries to simulate the basic bank account activites(deposit,withdrawing,bank statements,and transfer)

#how to open it.

1. Download the file and extract it using unzip,winrare or any ziping program might works.
2. Double click the .exe file to execute the program.
3. enjoy the program.

NB: If you try to move the .txt files associated with the program into another folder,
the program won't execute, as I passed a relative path not the absolute one. 

---The program doesn't refresh itself, so try to reopen it to see balance, after
some activities--or try to click 'All transactions' to see what you just did.

big thank to my mentor Ardit for the course and the motivation 
to do as little as this program but never give up.
